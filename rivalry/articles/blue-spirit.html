<article id="blue-spirt"><h3>Big Blue Spirit</h3><p>&ldquo;Andover/Exeter, to me, is a perfect time for the whole school to get together&hellip; I think my favorite part, other than when we win and can celebrate as a whole school, is when everyone is getting so hyped. Even though finals is the next week, every single year that I&rsquo;ve been there, I&rsquo;ve never even thought about it. I&rsquo;m just having the time of my life, supporting PA and just being with all my friends,&rdquo; said Blue Key Head Ben Andresen &rsquo;17, one of Andover&rsquo;s ten spirit leaders.</p><p>The weekend festivities mean something different to each member of the community.</p><p>&ldquo;Andover/Exeter is a big deal to me because it makes me feel like a part of something a lot bigger than just my team or just my sport. The whole history of it. It&rsquo;s also a chance for me to share something that I&rsquo;ve been a part of for a while now with the younger kids,&rdquo; said Andover Boys Soccer Co-Captain Peter Heckendorn &rsquo;17.</p><div class="inline"><div class="photo"><img src="assets/images/archives/AndoverExeter_BeckySykes_2006.png"/></div><span class="credit">Courtesy of the Phillips Academy Archives.</span><span class="caption">Becky Sykes poses with students on the steps of Samuel Phillips Hall during a 2006 Spirit Week.</span></div><p>Blue Key Heads organize an annual Spirit Week for the week leading up to A/E day. Each day of Spirit Week has a school-wide dress-up theme or &ldquo;psyche.&rdquo; This year&rsquo;s themes were &lsquo;Seasons,&rsquo; &lsquo;Twin Day,&rsquo; &lsquo;Superheros and Villians,&rsquo; &lsquo;Exeter Geek Day,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Big Blue Day.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Big Blue Day&rsquo; and the entire campus seems to wear blue – even the teachers and staff members get into it – I think it&rsquo;s awesome, as diverse as our community is, as many different viewpoints on as many different things we have around everything, kids who are into sports, kids who aren&rsquo;t into sports, they still show up and support the school,&rdquo; said Chris Capano, Director of Student Activities.</p><div class="quote"><blockquote>&ldquo;Big Blue spirit allows me to be me in the most genuine form.&rdquo;</blockquote><span class="speaker">Laura Bilal &rsquo;17</span></div><p>&ldquo;We had a tremendous spirit; football was the big game on campus&hellip; the stands were full&hellip; the buildup to the Exeter game was full of spirit. I can remember speaking in front of the whole school on Sam Phillips steps telling jokes. The band was there – this was the night before the game – the crowd was there,&rdquo; said George Bixby &rsquo;53.</p><p>The culmination of Spirit Week festivities is the Pep Rally. On the eve of A/E day each year, the student body congregates in Phelps Stadium to watch team dances and participate in cheers led by the Blue Key Heads. Prior to the construction of Phelps, the Pep Rally took place on the steps of Samuel Phillips Hall.</p><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have pep rallies except before the Exeter game. And [the football team] used to gather on the steps of Sam Phil&hellip; All the way from across Main Street came the whole student body and the band. They&rsquo;d coming marching up with the torch light and so on. And playing music and it was a rather exciting time,&rdquo; said Bassett.</p><div class="photos"><div><div class="photo"><img src="assets/images/archives/AndoverExeter_circa1980_02.png"/></div><span class="credit">Courtesy of the Phillips Academy Archives.</span><span class="caption">Students hang banners for Andover/Exeter Weekend in 1980.</span></div><div><div class="photo"><img src="assets/images/archives/AndoverExeter_circa1980.png"/></div><span class="credit">Courtesy of the Phillips Academy Archives.</span><span class="caption">Andover students hang a seized Exeter banner upside down.

I see A/E through a much more sentimental lens now,&rdquo; said Blue Key Head Auguste White &rsquo;17.</p><p>&ldquo;As a freshman, I was a lot more nervous about it. I didn&rsquo;t really recognize how exciting it was. I was worried about doing well and not messing up in front of everyone. But now it&rsquo;s definitely more about making the school proud, and making everyone who is watching proud of me,&rdquo; said Heckendorn.</p><p>Confidence was a common thread that influenced students&rsquo; views. &ldquo;As a freshman, I was kind of intimidated by Exeter. But having been here for three years, and beating them all three years, certainly has helped my confidence. And now I just know for sure that Andover is better than Exeter – it&rsquo;s not really a question – so we&rsquo;re just basically there to prove to them that we are better,&rdquo; said Eliot Zaeder &rsquo;17, a Blue Key Head and member of Andover Boys Soccer.</p></article>
