<article id="intro"><p>In 1878, a legendary rivalry was born. Red and blue blood mixed when rival schools Phillips Academy Andover and Phillips Exeter Academy battled on the football field for ultimate glory. Contrary to popular belief, this was not the first time that Andover and Exeter had faced off in athletics. In May of the same year, Andover met Exeter on the baseball field, only to suffer a tough 11-1 loss against its opponents in red.</p><div class="inline right"><div class="photo"><img src="assets/images/archives/AndoverExeter_1930.png"/></div><span class="credit">Courtesy of the Phillips Academy Archives.</span><span class="caption">Program cover from the 1930 A/E Weekend.</span></div><p>Six months later, on a chilly Sunday afternoon, &ldquo;the Andover eleven&rdquo; braved weather that &ldquo;threatened rain&rdquo; and secured its revenge with a crushing 22-0 victory on the gridiron. This game set the tone for the following 138 years of interscholastic competition.</p><p>According to <em>The Phillipian</em>&rsquo;s coverage of the game, &ldquo;Every Phillipian was jubilant over the well-earned victory of our eleven in the game with Exeter.&rdquo; Spectators expressed their jubilance with “frequent applause” – the equivalent of the rowdy cheers of today.</p><p>The competition that took place in 1878, however, was only an extension of a familial rivalry that had begun one hundred years before with the founding of Andover. As of this year, Andover has totaled 72 victories over Exeter, which has claimed only 54. The teams have shared 10 ties over the years.</p><p>In the midst of the American Revolution, 26-year-old Samuel Phillips sought the help of his uncle, John, to establish a school on Andover Hill. Phillips Academy was founded in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1778. Three years later, the elder Phillips founded a second Phillips Academy, 30 miles north, in Exeter, New Hampshire.</p><p>Though the schools shared a family name, relations between the schools were far from loving and familial. As Frederick S. Allis Jr. once wrote about the two schools, “There was really no reason for their working together.”</p><p>Yet, the family linkage between Andover and Exeter was in fact strengthened by the fierce rivalry brought by yearly athletic competitions. Aside from a short stint in the 1890s when a riot on the Exeter campus cancelled the games for two years, the competitions have continued on, through war and peace, as the ultimate high-school rivalry.</p><p>Over the years, Andover and Exeter have evolved with the changing times. Women have been incorporated into the academies; uniforms – at least on one campus – have been abolished; and sports other than football and baseball have been introduced to the athletics departments.</p><p>Now, 138 years later, both men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s teams compete each year for victory. Throughout a century of change, one thing has endured: the rivalry between Andover and Exeter.</p></article>
