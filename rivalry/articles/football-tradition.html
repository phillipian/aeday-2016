<article id="football-tradition"><h3>The Football Tradition</h3><p>Though each game counts equally towards the final score of A/E day (a tally of games won by both sides), the football game has historically been a stronghold of student interest and attendance.</p><p>&ldquo;Every team is just as important at Andover&hellip; as the football team. [But the] soccer and field hockey games were done, so we packed our side at Andover for sure against Exeter,&rdquo; said Brennen Keefe &rsquo;88, a Post-Graduate (PG) who played in the 1987 A/E game that Andover won 14-13.</p><div class="photos"><div><div class="photo"><img src="assets/images/archives/AndoverExeter_1897FootballSquad_1898.png"/></div><span class="credit">Courtesy of the Phillips Academy Archives.</span><span class="caption">The 1898 Andover Football team.

So, practically everybody in the school&hellip; played football,&rdquo; said Mike Bassett &rsquo;60.</p><p>Over the course of 136 contests, Andover&rsquo;s football team has emerged victorious 72 times to Exeter&rsquo;s 54. In addition, the schools have tied ten times. Yet no matter who wins or loses, the school spirit that accompanies each weekend of competition with Exeter is exciting in its own right.</p><div class="photos"><div><div class="photo"><img src="assets/images/archives/AndoverExeter_Globe_1910.png"/></div><span class="credit">Courtesy of the Phillips Academy Archives.</span><span class="caption">A cartoon in the Boston Globe details Andover's 1910 win over Exeter.
