<article id="tough-losses"><h3>Great Wins</h3><p>Andover avenged its dreadful 1956 loss with a 45-6 win the following year.</p><p>&ldquo;The following year, we played up there at Exeter, and we beat them. I was playing halfback, and we had quite a team. We had our own boys, we brought in a couple of PGs. That was a bright sunny day, it wasn&rsquo;t bitterly cold, up in Exeter,&rdquo; said Bassett.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it turned out, we did so well we matched the score that they had beaten us by the year before. In fact, by the time we were looking at it, we made the last touchdown and I remember we were in the a huddle and a couple of guys said, &lsquo;You know, if we don&rsquo;t give Exeter a point, we will have the same score and it will be reversed,&rsquo; &rdquo; he continued, who captained the 1957 team.</p><div class="quote"><blockquote>&ldquo;Beating Exeter was everything.&rdquo;</blockquote><span class="speaker">Garth Williams &rsquo;97</span></div><p>Even though the 1957 team had a strong season, the win against Exeter was all it needed to call the year a success. The A/E game has the power to both validate and call into question a season&rsquo;s performance. Athletes from all eras acknowledge the importance of a strong showing on A/E day.</p><p>Keefe, after playing one year at Andover, said, &ldquo;There was definitely a sense that you could not win any games throughout the year, but if you won the Exeter game, that was a successful season. Of course you wanted to win all of your games, but that one win could kind of make up for having an average season.&rdquo;</p><p>Garth Williams &rsquo;97 played football for four years at Andover, and captained the Varsity team his Senior year. He remarked that pre-game speeches and pep talks were not needed on A/E day, as the team was already intensely concentrated on the game.</p><video class="video-js" id="my-video" controls="" preload="auto" poster="assets/videos/thumbs/Williams-7.png" data-setup=""><source src="assets/videos/Williams-7.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that<a href="http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the importance of the game was lost on anybody. It&rsquo;s one of those games that the whole week leading into it has a different level of focus and intensity throughout the practice week. The whole campus is feeling it, there&rsquo;s an electricity,&rdquo; said Williams.</p><div class="inline"><div class="photo"><img src="assets/images/archives/AndoverExeter1980Oct25byTimPlass_01.png"/></div><span class="credit">Courtesy of Phillips Academy Archives.</span><span class="caption">Photos from Tim Plass depict the Andover section at the 1980 Andover/Exeter Weekend.</span></div></article>
