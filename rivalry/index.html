Red and blue blood mixed when rival schools Phillips Academy Andover and Phillips Exeter Academy battled on the football field for ultimate glory. Contrary to popular belief, this was not the first time that Andover and Exeter had faced off in athletics. In May of the same year, Andover met Exeter on the baseball field, only to suffer a tough 11-1 loss against its opponents in red.</p><div class="inline right"><div class="photo"><img src="assets/images/archives/AndoverExeter_1930.png"/></div><span class="credit">Courtesy of the Phillips Academy Archives.</span><span class="caption">Program cover from the 1930 A/E Weekend.</span></div><p>Six months later, on a chilly Sunday afternoon, &ldquo;the Andover eleven&rdquo; braved weather that &ldquo;threatened rain&rdquo; and secured its revenge with a crushing 22-0 victory on the gridiron. This game set the tone for the following 138 years of interscholastic competition.</p><p>According to <em>The Phillipian</em>&rsquo;s coverage of the game, &ldquo;Every Phillipian was jubilant over the well-earned victory of our eleven in the game with Exeter.&rdquo; Spectators expressed their jubilance with “frequent applause” – the equivalent of the rowdy cheers of today.</p><p>The competition that took place in 1878, however, was only an extension of a familial rivalry that had begun one hundred years before with the founding of Andover. As of this year, Andover has totaled 72 victories over Exeter, which has claimed only 54. The teams have shared 10 ties over the years.</p><p>In the midst of the American Revolution, 26-year-old Samuel Phillips sought the help of his uncle, John, to establish a school on Andover Hill. Phillips Academy was founded in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1778. Three years later, the elder Phillips founded a second Phillips Academy, 30 miles north, in Exeter, New Hampshire.</p><p>Though the schools shared a family name, relations between the schools were far from loving and familial. As Frederick S. Allis Jr. once wrote about the two schools, “There was really no reason for their working together.”</p><p>Yet, the family linkage between Andover and Exeter was in fact strengthened by the fierce rivalry brought by yearly athletic competitions. Aside from a short stint in the 1890s when a riot on the Exeter campus cancelled the games for two years, the competitions have continued on, through war and peace, as the ultimate high-school rivalry.</p><p>Over the years, Andover and Exeter have evolved with the changing times. Women have been incorporated into the academies; uniforms – at least on one campus – have been abolished; and sports other than football and baseball have been introduced to the athletics departments.</p><p>Now, 138 years later, both men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s teams compete each year for victory. Throughout a century of change, one thing has endured: the rivalry between Andover and Exeter.</p></article><section class="banner"><div class="frame"><img src="assets/images/sports/ae2015.png"/></div><span class="credit">Courtesy of Phillips Academy.</span><caption><p>The 2015 Andover team celebrates a touchdown.

In addition, the schools have tied ten times.

On the eve of A/E day each year, the student body congregates in Phelps Stadium to watch team dances and participate in cheers led by the Blue Key Heads. Prior to the construction of Phelps, the Pep Rally took place on the steps of Samuel Phillips Hall.</p><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have pep rallies except before the Exeter game. And [the football team] used to gather on the steps of Sam Phil&hellip; All the way from across Main Street came the whole student body and the band.

I see A/E through a much more sentimental lens now,&rdquo; said Blue Key Head Auguste White &rsquo;17.</p><p>&ldquo;As a freshman, I was a lot more nervous about it. I didn&rsquo;t really recognize how exciting it was. I was worried about doing well and not messing up in front of everyone. But now it&rsquo;s definitely more about making the school proud, and making everyone who is watching proud of me,&rdquo; said Heckendorn.</p><p>Confidence was a common thread that influenced students&rsquo; views. &ldquo;As a freshman, I was kind of intimidated by Exeter. But having been here for three years, and beating them all three years, certainly has helped my confidence. And now I just know for sure that Andover is better than Exeter – it&rsquo;s not really a question – so we&rsquo;re just basically there to prove to them that we are better,&rdquo; said Eliot Zaeder &rsquo;17, a Blue Key Head and member of Andover Boys Soccer.</p></article><section class="banner"><div class="frame"><img src="assets/images/archives/AndoverExeter_1958_byTedPolumbaum.png"/></div><span class="credit">Courtesy of the Phillips Academy Archives.</span><caption><p>A vendor sells Andover and Exeter banners, amongst other tchotchke as Andover boys get ready to parade in 1958.</p></caption></section><article id="tough-losses"><h3>Tough Losses</h3><p>After a season of preparation and anticipation, nothing dampens the mood of A/E Weekend like a loss to Exeter.</p><p>&ldquo;All I remember was it was bitterly cold and they were beating us so badly that near the end they let me get into the game as a quarterback, and my ankles were practically frozen.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Andover played few games against other high schools. Instead, it faced a schedule laden with college freshman teams.</p><p>&ldquo;The only prep-school team that we played was Exeter. We played Mass Maritime freshmen, Harvard freshmen, Wesleyan freshmen, Amherst freshmen, Springfield freshmen, and Tufts freshmen,&rdquo; said Bixby.</p><video class="video-js" id="my-video" controls="" preload="auto" poster="assets/videos/thumbs/Bixby-1.png" data-setup=""><source src="assets/videos/Bixby-1.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that<a href="http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video><p>Gil Bamford &rsquo;58, who captained Andover&rsquo;s football team in 1957, said, &ldquo;We played a lot of college freshman teams in those days. In fact, we basically played Exeter and I think that was it. My Senior year we played Exeter, Deerfield, and Hermon, but the rest of the games were against&hellip; the smaller colleges that had freshman teams in those days.&rdquo;</p><p>Bassett, who played four years of football at Andover, said, &ldquo;Before I got [to Andover]&hellip; in the late forties [and] until probably into the early fifties, they used to play the Ivy League Freshman Teams. They were very serious football in the Ivy Leagues. But then the Ivies got too big, so we played Williams and Amherst and Bowdoin and Northeastern and Tufts. And then Exeter, and then we gradually built in Mount Hermon and Deerfield before the Exeter game. Andover and Exeter didn&rsquo;t play in any prep school league.&rdquo;</p><p>Because the A/E game was one of the only times during the season that Andover athletes went head-to-head with their peers, the competition was amplified and the severity of a loss was multiplied.</p><p>Exeter toppled Andover 45-6 on a cold November day in 1956. Exeter&rsquo;s head coach was in his final year at the helm of the Exeter football program and had built a team not only to win, but to dominate.</p><p>&ldquo;Exeter&rsquo;s coach was going to be retiring that year and so he brought in a major number of Post-Grads, PGs, and the most outstanding one was the quarterback,&rdquo; said Bamford, a member of Andover&rsquo;s 1956 team.</p><p>&ldquo;That year, Exeter was really loaded. They had a lot of PGs because it was the year that their coach – it was going to be his final year before he retired. So they really loaded up and they had an outstanding group of ball players,&rdquo; Bamford continued.</p><p>Andover was the clear underdog, and facing an Exeter team full of stars did not bode well after a particularly rough season.</p><div class="inline"><div class="photo"><img src="assets/images/archives/AndoverExeter_OWHL_GarverRm_nd.png"/></div><span class="credit">Courtesy of the Phillips Academy Archives.</span><span class="caption">Banners hang in "silent study" (the Garver Room) in Oliver Wendell Holmes Library.</span></div><p>&ldquo;We had a poor season leading up to the Exeter game. But that was a big event, not just the Andover/Exeter game, but that was my first year at Andover. And that game was so bitterly cold, the other three games were much more pleasant weather. Oh god, was it cold. All I remember. I don&rsquo;t think I played a game that was that cold ever. Anywhere, in college, or anywhere,&rdquo; said Bassett. He and Bamford overlapped at Andover for two years in the 1950s.</p><p>In such a tense rivalry, a loss like the one Andover sustained in 1956 is devastating. But the cold – and the loss – did not linger for long.</p></article><section class="banner"><div class="frame"><img src="assets/images/archives/AndoverExeterFootball_Cheer_1958.png"/></div><span class="credit">Courtesy of the Phillips Academy Archives.</span><caption><p>1958 Andover students cheer at a rally for Andover/Exeter Weekend.</p></caption></section><article id="tough-losses"><h3>Great Wins</h3><p>Andover avenged its dreadful 1956 loss with a 45-6 win the following year.</p><p>&ldquo;The following year, we played up there at Exeter, and we beat them.

That was a bright sunny day, it wasn&rsquo;t bitterly cold, up in Exeter,&rdquo; said Bassett.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it turned out, we did so well we matched the score that they had beaten us by the year before. In fact, by the time we were looking at it, we made the last touchdown and I remember we were in the a huddle and a couple of guys said, &lsquo;You know, if we don&rsquo;t give Exeter a point, we will have the same score and it will be reversed,&rsquo; &rdquo; he continued, who captained the 1957 team.</p><div class="quote"><blockquote>&ldquo;Beating Exeter was everything.&rdquo;</blockquote><span class="speaker">Garth Williams &rsquo;97</span></div><p>Even though the 1957 team had a strong season, the win against Exeter was all it needed to call the year a success. The A/E game has the power to both validate and call into question a season&rsquo;s performance. Athletes from all eras acknowledge the importance of a strong showing on A/E day.</p><p>Keefe, after playing one year at Andover, said, &ldquo;There was definitely a sense that you could not win any games throughout the year, but if you won the Exeter game, that was a successful season. Of course you wanted to win all of your games, but that one win could kind of make up for having an average season.&rdquo;</p><p>Garth Williams &rsquo;97 played football for four years at Andover, and captained the Varsity team his Senior year. He remarked that pre-game speeches and pep talks were not needed on A/E day, as the team was already intensely concentrated on the game.</p><video class="video-js" id="my-video" controls="" preload="auto" poster="assets/videos/thumbs/Williams-7.png" data-setup=""><source src="assets/videos/Williams-7.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that<a href="http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the importance of the game was lost on anybody.
